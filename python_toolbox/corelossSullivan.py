# CORELOSS Calculate power loss in a ferrite core.

#   CORELOSS(time, B, alpha, beta, k, suppressFlag)
#
#   time and B are a piecewise linear series of data points
#   time = vector of successive time values corresponding to flux values, in seconds.
#   B = vector of flux densities corresponding to time vector values, in tesla.
#   alpha, beta, k = Steinmetz parameters.  Must be for use with MKS units
#   suppressFlag: 0 to display input plot, loss  and error information in the
#                   command window.
#                 1 to suppress all output and only return the loss value.
#                   If an error occurs, CORELOSS will return -1.
#             
#   CORELOSS will calculate the power loss in your specified ferrite core.
#   The loss value is in W/m^3.
